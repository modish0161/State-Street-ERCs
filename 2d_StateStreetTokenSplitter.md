### Token Lifecycle Management Contracts

---

**Topic:** Token Lifecycle Management Contracts  
**Use Case:** Token Splitting/Merging Contract - Allows for the splitting of tokens into smaller units or the merging of smaller units into larger tokens.

---

### Objective

To generate a secure and reliable smart contract that enables the splitting of tokens into smaller units or the merging of smaller units into larger tokens. This contract should support various scenarios where token holders need to adjust their token quantities while ensuring compliance with industry standards and best practices.

---

### **Smart Contract Type**

- **Type:** ERC-20 (Fungible Token) with Token Splitting/Merging Functionality
- **Description:** This contract manages the splitting and merging of ERC-20 tokens. It allows token holders to split their tokens into smaller units or merge smaller units into larger tokens, depending on their needs.

---

### **Core Features**

1. **Token Splitting and Merging:**
   - **Functions:**
     - `splitTokens(uint256 splitRatio)`: Splits the caller's tokens into smaller units based on the specified split ratio.
     - `mergeTokens(uint256 mergeRatio)`: Merges the caller's tokens into larger units based on the specified merge ratio.
   - **State Variables:**
     - `uint256 public totalSupply`: Tracks the total supply of tokens, adjusted after each split or merge.
   - **Modifiers:**
     - `validSplitRatio(uint256 splitRatio)`: Ensures the split ratio is valid and non-zero.
     - `validMergeRatio(uint256 mergeRatio)`: Ensures the merge ratio is valid and non-zero.

2. **Tokenomics Adjustments:**
   - **Functions:**
     - `updateTokenomicsAfterSplit(uint256 splitRatio)`: Adjusts the tokenomics after a split operation.
     - `updateTokenomicsAfterMerge(uint256 mergeRatio)`: Adjusts the tokenomics after a merge operation.
   - **State Variables:**
     - `uint256 public splitCount`: Tracks the number of times tokens have been split.
     - `uint256 public mergeCount`: Tracks the number of times tokens have been merged.

3. **Compliance and Security:**
   - **Functions:**
     - `pauseContract()`: Pauses all token operations in case of an emergency.
     - `unpauseContract()`: Resumes normal operations after an emergency.
   - **State Variables:**
     - `bool public contractPaused`: Indicates whether the contract is currently paused.

4. **Event Logging:**
   - **Events:**
     - `TokensSplit(address indexed account, uint256 originalAmount, uint256 newAmount, uint256 splitRatio)`
     - `TokensMerged(address indexed account, uint256 originalAmount, uint256 newAmount, uint256 mergeRatio)`
     - `ContractPaused()`
     - `ContractUnpaused()`

### **Standards and Protocols**

- **ERC Standards:**
  - **ERC-20**: The contract will adhere to the ERC-20 standard for fungible tokens.
- **Protocols:** None specific, but it will be compatible with standard ERC-20 interfaces.

---

### **OpenZeppelin Integration**

- **Base Contracts:**
  - `ERC20`: Provides the foundational ERC-20 token functionality.
  - `Ownable`: Ensures only the contract owner can perform specific operations.
  - `Pausable`: Enables the ability to pause contract operations in emergencies.
  - `ReentrancyGuard`: Protects against reentrancy attacks during sensitive operations.
- **Security Features:**
  - Uses Solidity 0.8.x built-in protections against overflow/underflow, negating the need for `SafeMath`.

---

### **Security Considerations**

- **Access Control:**
  - Only the owner can update tokenomics or pause the contract.
  - Token holders can perform splits and merges within the allowed ratios.
- **Reentrancy:** All state-changing functions use `ReentrancyGuard` to prevent attacks.
- **Testing:** Comprehensive unit tests will be written to cover all scenarios and edge cases, especially around splitting and merging tokens.

---

### **Deployment**

- **Deployment Script:**
  - A deployment script will be provided for deploying the contract on Ethereum, specifying the network (mainnet or testnet).
- **Gas Optimization:**
  - Implement gas-efficient coding practices, such as optimizing storage and minimizing redundant operations.

---

### **Interactivity**

- **Functions:**
  - `splitTokens(uint256 splitRatio)`
  - `mergeTokens(uint256 mergeRatio)`
  - `updateTokenomicsAfterSplit(uint256 splitRatio)`
  - `updateTokenomicsAfterMerge(uint256 mergeRatio)`
  - `pauseContract()`
  - `unpauseContract()`
- **Events:**
  - `TokensSplit(address indexed account, uint256 originalAmount, uint256 newAmount, uint256 splitRatio)`
  - `TokensMerged(address indexed account, uint256 originalAmount, uint256 newAmount, uint256 mergeRatio)`
  - `ContractPaused()`
  - `ContractUnpaused()`

---

### **Upgradability and Maintenance**

- **Upgradeability:**
  - The contract can implement a proxy pattern for upgradeability if required.
- **Maintenance:**
  - Regular audits and updates should be planned to address any changes in regulatory requirements or security standards.

---

### **Documentation**

- **Code Comments:**
  - Detailed comments throughout the codebase to explain the purpose and functionality of each component.
- **User Guide:**
  - A comprehensive guide that includes instructions for interacting with the contract, including examples of splitting and merging tokens.

---

### **Compliance and Legal**

- **Regulatory Compliance:**
  - The contract should ensure that token splitting and merging operations comply with relevant legal requirements, particularly for securities regulations.
- **Terms of Use:**
  - Include terms of use and legal disclaimers within the documentation.

---

### **Testing and Verification**

- **Unit Tests:**
  - Develop unit tests to cover all functions, including edge cases for token splitting and merging.
- **Integration Tests:**
  - Ensure the contract interacts correctly with other smart contracts and external systems.
- **Verification:**
  - Verify the contract source code on blockchain explorers like Etherscan upon deployment to public networks.

---

### **Additional Considerations**

- **Oracle Integration:** Not applicable for this contract.
- **Tokenomics:** The contract should clearly define rules around token splitting and merging to ensure transparency and compliance.
- **Governance:** Consider governance mechanisms if the contract will be managed by a DAO or similar structure.
